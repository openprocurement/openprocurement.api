"In addition to providing fields and their values in a request, you may also "
"specify options to control how your request is interpreted and how the "
"response is generated.  For GET requests, options are specified as URL "
"parameters prefixed with `opt_`.  For POST or PUT requests, options are "
"specified in the body, inside the top-level options object (a sibling of the"
" data object).  The option specified in the body overrides the `opt_` one "
"from URL parameter."

"Provides the response in \"pretty\" output.  In the case of JSON this means "
"doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable.  This will "
"take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to "
"use this during debugging."

" to come from within browsers and work around the \"same origin policy.\" "
"The function named as the value of the `opt_jsonp` parameter will be called "
"with a single argument, a JavaScript object representing the response."
